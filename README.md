# Quantum-Computing
This repo contains code and report developed as part of a project in subject FYS5419 - Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning by the University of Oslo. The main topic of the 
project is concerned about the simulation of one-, two- and many-body quantum systems, including the famous Lipkin model. All code used to solve the Hamiltonians of the different systems 
studied as part of this project can be found in directory "src", while the code used to generate the results presented in the report ("paper.pdf" in doc directory) can be found in a seperate 
directory within "src" called "runs". The latter contains six programs which correspond to the various parts of the the project, starting with the programs "gates_task_a.py" amd "bell_task_a.py", 
which correspond to part A. To run all the programs, including those two, you only need to run the following command: 

```
python3 <file_name.py>
